# graphs_JoachinK

A comprehensive Python library implementing fundamental graph algorithms for shortest path finding and graph analysis.

## Overview

This package provides efficient implementations of essential graph algorithms, designed for both educational purposes and practical applications. The library currently includes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for unweighted graphs, along with graph connectivity analysis tools.

## Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Find shortest paths in weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Find shortest paths in unweighted graphs
